[![Silverstripe supported module](https://img.shields.io/badge/silverstripe-supported-0071C4.svg)](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/addons/silverstripe-commercially-supported-module-list/)

This modules serves Silverstripe data as
[GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html)
representations, with helpers to generate schemas based on Silverstripe model
introspection. It layers a pluggable schema registration system on top of the
[graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) library. The APIs are
very similar.

## This is the 4.x release branch

If you are looking for version 3 [check the `3` branch](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/tree/3), which contains documentation inlined into the README.

## Installing on silverstripe/recipe-cms < 4.11

If your project uses `silverstripe/recipe-cms`, you cannot install the stable version 4 release. You can use version 3 (which will be installed by default), or you can swap to the alpha of version 4 by running this command:

```
composer require silverstripe/graphql:^4.0.0-alpha --with-all-dependencies
```

Alternatively, you can remove `silverstripe/recipe-cms` from your root `composer.json` and replace it with the contents of the `composer.json` in `silverstripe/recipe-cms`.
